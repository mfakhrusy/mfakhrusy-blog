# Hi!

First of all, I'm currently software developer by trade, with the focus in the frontend section of the web platform. My only professional experience is with reactJS at the moment of writing this post

This is the first post of a long series of post that I hope I can keep writing about my journey to be a cybersecurity expert. I'm still not sure whether I'll move to a cybersecurity job or keep my job as a software developer and learn this as a side gig, we'll see later!

Why cyber security, specifically? Why not just keep pursuing what you do currently and be very good at it? Isn't it risky to gamble away your life to something that can be considered as a very different topic?

Well, you can say my job as a software developer was a risky move since I'm actually a aerospace engineering graduate and learn programming on the side, to finally enter the software developer market so I can say that I have experience a risky move in life, that's nothing new!

That said, why cyber security? because hacking, of course! ehm, I mean, can't disagree with that but sound a little bit cheeky so let me rephrase.

I'm astonished by the "hacking" subject of cyber security and willing to devote myself to learn more about it. Hacking means offensive security (since there are also defensive security) and I think (at this moment) that feeling of astonishment is what spark my interest of learning about cyber security in general.

That said, I'm 100% realize I'm not cut out of this, in terms of my own knowledge. So, after a few deliberations on my own, I think I'm gonna approach cyber security in 2 ways: THE CRUNCH.

What is The Crunch? 

Well, you know the theory of The Big Crunch right? The theory that said (VERY ROUGHLY) after universe is expanding enough, it just like "kay I think I'm done and I'll just crunch this thing again".

Okay okay it actually doesn't tell anything but The Crunch is literally my self-made term about approaching the subject with both "bottom-up" and "top-down" method.

Alright, what is considered "bottom-up" and "top-down" in cyber security space, then?

Well! I think:

## top-down

1. learn hacking by copy paste "stuffs" from unknown blogspot
2. deliberately visit any online CTF/hack practice without knowing anything at all

well basically "script kiddies"

## bottom-up

1. learn fundamentals of network
2. learn programming languages, frameworks, databases
3. learn about vulnerabilities about different platform

you get the gist, this is structured learning basically.

Then, how about The Crunch? It combines both of them so you still know the fundamentals while having fun being a script kiddy.

You approach the subject both from the top and the bottom, pretty neat, right?

## The Crunch: My Approach

1. Learn fundamentals of network
2. Try CTF/hack practice in between learning
3. Learn web frontend vulnerabilities (because I'm a frontend dev)
4. learn other web technologies (other languages, other framework), and their vulnerabilities
5. try hacking practice with reproducing the vulnerabilities yourself or try to check whether there are any hacking services for it
6. learn other platforms (IoTs, androids, etc)
7. and so on

Basically I want to keep my learning interesting enough without sacrificing my fundamentals.

Right now, I'm just a one trick pony. I know reactJS, and basically nothing more. I need to broaden my knowledge and keep learning things.

So that concludes my first post of learning cyber security, see you around!
