## Declaration

I declared on the pretentious homepage heading that this blog will contains 3 parts:

- Code
- Science
- Math

Will the blog will be filled with posts on the exact order (Code, then Science, then Math, then repeat) ?

Will the blog will have the same amount of percentage from each, "part" ?

Will there be a post that I "coagulate" two or more parts into one, blob of post ?

Will there be a time where the author, stop being pretentious ?

Will I keep writing ?

Is Science different than Math ?


1. No, or Maybe, or Yes, or a state between those 3,
2. extremely improbable, but, I don't know, 
3. that seems like a good idea,
4. it's not for me to judge,
5. I bloody hope so.
6. according to reddit posts that I googled exactly when I write this post, on [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PhilosophyofScience/comments/35aq67/why_is_mathematics_considered_a_science/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/zyp52/why_exactly_is_mathematics_the_most_pure_science/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/evfi11/is_math_actually_related_to_science/), it's "in a soft-side of a no". However, since I want to try to be as philosophical as I can hence my answer would be: "I'm not sure, is it?".

## Disclaimer

This post will not contain any knowledge, or any useful thing, really, but since you read this, you either:

1. just skim the heading and skip the first section of the post,
2. read all the things

and for either one, I just hope that this post is a great summary (or introduction) of what's to come.

## Apologize in advance

I'm not a native english speaker, so pardon me if I make some silly grammar mistakes or wrong word usage. 

If you have something to fix or improve in the language side of the blog, I'm very eager to know and you can reach me on many platforms that I wrote in the site's footer, or [my email](mailto:fakhrusy.m@gmail.com) even if it's just a nitpick.
