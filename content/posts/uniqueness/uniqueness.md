"I am unique"

"I am unique"

"I am unique"

I bet most (if not every) people has in a way or two declared themselves is unique.

"I am unique in my way of thinking, I don't want to be boxed by generic personality traits, I have my own way of things, which makes who I am."

You know the MBTI, right? the [not-so-scientific](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/give-and-take/201309/goodbye-mbti-the-fad-won-t-die) psychology test that's well known to I think, everyone? well at least the people below 40 should have at least heard of it once.

On the article that I linked, it is said that "Those who love type, have been seduced by an image of their own ideal self" of which it's been taken from [this book](https://www.amazon.com/The-Cult-Personality-Testing-Misunderstand/dp/0743280725/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1379425648&sr=8-1&keywords=cult+of+personality+testing).

We've all seen many shares from our friends and acquaintances about their so-"unique" traits of MBTI.

But given MBTI contains just 16 generic classification and people said they are "unique" based on that, is it kind of, irony?

Oh wait, the most irony about all of this is the talk about introvert-extrovert.

Introverted people keep saying they are "unique", "different", "not belong to the world", and other introverted-jargon.

But if introvert are... unique, and there are only two types, isn't that make them... non-unique? as in, 50% non-unique? If you take ambivert into this, they're still 33% non-unique, because the other two are also 33%.

Can I divide the whole population into two?

1. the kind-of introverted people
2. the not-so introverted people

From my own experience, the former tend to talk so much about themselves being unique, different, and not belong to this world that I feel sick about it. (hey, I was happened to have that kind of phase too you know, so I understand them, kind of, and I am sick of being like that, so I stopped)

Or maybe there's a guy who force themselves into a uniqueness by deliberately show people that they, in fact, an introvert. Although in real life they lay between the "edge side of a not-so introverted person", if I take the standard that introverted means "like to be alone". 

However, if I take the perceived definition on MBTIs introverted type of "charge their energy by being alone", I might be wrong and everyone can actually say themselves introverted because, hey, sleeping is mostly be done alone, right? and it charges you, right? Even if you're married, you still sleep as a solitude entity, alone, you don't share the sleeping state between partners.

=================

Will be continued later, after I read some books, maybe. 

I want to delve into this, I really do, I actually just realized that I love psychology, so I want to read and write more about this science (yep, science!).

Thanks.
